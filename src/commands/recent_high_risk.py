# TODO implement this command
# Provides a list of recent high risk commits based on 
# - the number of lines changed and the number of files changed in a single commit
# - if the commit contains key words like password, refactor, etc.
# - if it's the firs time a person is committing a file of that type (ie first controller)

# Should have a default span of 5 days but can be changed
